Use this file to register bugs or to check the status of bugs.
This file consists of a number of sections:

- a section for the next release
- current

Each section is subdivided into subsections:

- new features
- critical bugs (crashes etc.)
- general bugs (unwanted behaviour)
- hardware problems

Each line in a subsection discribes a bug or new feature and
starts with a single character indicating the status of the bug.
Here's an overview:

- bug is new and not assigned
X an uppercase letter, bug is assigned to TEGHJNF (Ton, Erwin, Gino...)

Remarks can be added on a new line starting with two spaces.

Whenever a bug has been fixed, the engineer removes the line(s) from the
current section up to the next release section.

Example files will be located in server:/home/develop/bugs . The naming
convention for these files is: YYMMDD-NN-short-discription.blend . When
more files are needed to reproduce the bug they start with the same
YYMMDD-NN numbers or they are stored in a subdirectory. Whenever a bug
is fixed, please move the file(s) to the bugs/fixed subdirectory.

Readme's and general remarks will be stored in a text window in the 
example file. Information needed for the release log, can be stored in
this file.

-------- Release 2.04 -----------------

--- enhancement requests

--- new features
N Edge rendering has been added for the unified renderer. There is a
  button that switches between edge-rendering only solid faces, and 
  edge-rendering both solid and transparent faces.

--- critical bugs

--- minor bugs
F (LayBack) blender -h reports wrong version number
T (skywriter@mrnutty.com)  dynamic actors were drawn twice, this gave a noticable slowdown at systems with slow graphics
F (LayBack) toolbox menu had an obsolete entry 'PrintWeights'
N (predrag.kurtovic@st.hinet.hr) halo render bug in unified renderer:
  modified oversampling rules
N (matthias_heinzel@eprservice.de) unified renderer crashes:
  added guard for switching on uninitialised data
F (yldiz@yahoo.fr) clicking rightmouse when grabing / rotating / scaling in image window now cancels action
F (carsten@blender.nl) 'Update:' label in metaball editbuttons was drawn incorrectly
F (frank@blender.nl) fixed reading B&W Targa on little endian machines

-------- Current ----------

--- enhancement requests

T (PaulM) redesign view buttons interface
- (blenderman@free.fr) blender uses 'Show Bounds' flag to visualy indicate that an object is a sector. Deactivating the sector button doesn't reset this flag. Solution: add a new drawing flag to an object instead
T (calli) info window can't be scrolled or zoomed
T (WP) use spacebar menu, add circle, and cancel action: blender is in edit mode with an empty object
- (mikko.alfthan@zoo-gate.fi) intersect option is unstable and sometimes crashes blender
- plugins don't work on BeOS 
- play back of audio in the audio window 
T (mrnutty@mrnutty.com) game buttons aren't centered correctly vertically when selecting objects
- (LayBack) add Image select window to load images in Image window
- (LayBack) add editing option in oops window
- (LayBack) add visualizing TX ObData in oops windows


--- critical bugs


--- minor bugs

E realtime lighting incorrect on mirrored objects 
- packed animations aren't rendered correctly. The animated texture code relies on filenames and file pointers and should be rewritten to handle texture files in memory 
T (game) "Fh" system doesn't allow rotations of sector/props other than Z-rotations 
T (game) Delta Ipo's don't work 
J export of UV coordinates in VRML is not 100% correct (triangles). 

F (gnaf) (glut related!) 000815-01-render-3dwindow.blend produces incorrect first image on IRIX machines
J (PaulM) the image window (SHIFT-F10) doesn't allow zoom factors < 1.0 . This causes problems with images larger than the screen

--- unconfirmed

- problems with playing sound on NT
